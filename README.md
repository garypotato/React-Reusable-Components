# TS Components
Reusable components which allows you to customise components and can be easily installed through `npm`. 

## What I want to achieve
1. write in `Typescript`
2. Copy the component from `ant design`
3. components can be customized by `props`
4. test each components by using `Jest` + `Enzyme`
5. publish in `npm` allows me to reuse them in the future
6. use `prettier` as code formatter. I don't use `estlint` in this stage
7. use `husky` + `commitlint` + `lint-stage` to formate each `git commit`
